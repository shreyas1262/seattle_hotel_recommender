# seattle_hotel_recommender

This Project uses NLP techniques to build a Content Based Recommender System for hotels in Seattle. The dataset consists of 152 Hotels. I have performed EDA to understand the top words used to describe a hotel. The recommender system uses cosine similarity to identify the best suited hotel.
